I'm web developer. I prefer working a full stack (with experience handling **Rails**, **Django**, and **Node** backends and maintaining **PostgreSQL** databases), but I'm especially passionate about building **responsive**, **engaging**, and **accessible interfaces**. I'm a proud JavaScript nerd, and I've worked with **React**, **React Native**, **PolymerJS**, and **Vue.js**.

My background is in physics, which is where I took my first courses in scientific computing and such. That was OK, but I much prefer what I'm doing now with software. The pace suits me better.

Outside of work, I spend most of my time playing music and putting together community events as a member of various grassroots organizations I'm part of here in Toronto.
