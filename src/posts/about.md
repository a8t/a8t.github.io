I'm web developer. I prefer working a full stack (with experience handling **Rails** and **Django** backends), but I'm especially passionate about building **responsive**, **engaging**, and **accessible interfaces**. I'm a proud JavaScript nerd, and I've worked with **PolymerJS**, **Vue.js**, and **React**. I refuse to let myself stop learning, and that's why the web is so awesome to meâ€”there will never be a shortage of things to learn.

I love SVG and animation. I know my way around Illustrator, and I'm picking up GSAP for animation on the web. It's an exciting platform that's going in exciting places!

My background is in physics. That was OK, but I much prefer what I'm doing now with software. Outside of work, I'm a serial hobbyist. I crochet, sew, fix bikes, play guitar and lap steel, rock at Tetris, and love cryptic crosswords. You could say that I'm a jack of many trades, but mostly **I'm just terrified of being bored**.

[Here are some photos of my dog](https://photos.app.goo.gl/bOt9D5K8O0fej76x2). His name was Scrappy and I loved him very much!
